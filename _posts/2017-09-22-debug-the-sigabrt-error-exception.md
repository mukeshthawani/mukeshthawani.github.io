libc++abi.dylib: terminating with uncaught exception of type NSException

These are very common errors in iOS development. Sometimes you know why it's happening? when you just changed something and you keep seeing this error, but in some cases, you don't know which line of code is the reason behind this error. Let's take the first case where you know which line of code caused this error, still, you don't know what's wrong with that. There were no build time errors so you are not sure what could be the reason? You want more information and `Thread 1: signal SIGABRT` is not helping you in debugging. In this post, I will share how I debug these errors.

### Exception Breakpoint

The first step is to add an exception breakpoint. Unlike other breakpoints, it's not something we set on a specific line and evaluate what went wrong. Exception breakpoint will stop the execution whenever there is a problem anywhere in our program. From there we can evaluate what was the reason behind that crash.

To add an exception breakpoint click on the breakpoint navigator and then on the plus button at the bottom.

Once you click on the Exception Breakpoint then it will look like this:

Now it will stop whenever there is a problem. In the next step, we will see how to print the error.

### Error description

In the second step, we will add an action. So, edit the exception you just added in the last step. Once you click on the edit button you will see the "Add Action" button, click on that. Then choose the "Debugger command" option from the list.

In the debugger command field write `po $arg1`

Now you will see the error printed on your Xcode console.

### User Breakpoints

In this step, we will place the exception breakpoint in the user breakpoint. Once this is done then it will be available for all your projects. ðŸš€ 

To place the exception breakpoint in the user breakpoint, right click on the exception and select "Move Breakpoint To" then tap "User" and you are done. Now you can check your other projects, it will be present in all your projects.

That's it. Now whenever an error occurs, your program execution will stop and you will see the error printed on your Xcode console.

There are some other breakpoints which you should add in all yours projects. I recommend reading [this](https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2017/user-breakpoints-in-xcode/) blog post by Michael Ochs on different breakpoints.
